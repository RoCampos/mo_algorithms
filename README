This project tries to make a generic independent-problem multiobjetive
optimization framework. 

The purpose of the project is provide the implementation of the main 
multiobjective algorithms in a generic way. In this case, the final
user of the framework is able to configurate his specific optimization
problem without thinking about the optimizer.

The project started with NSGA2(Non-Sorted Genetic Algorithm 2) and 
SPEA2 (Strenght Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2) and a generic
representatino of a individual and a problem_info class that it represents
informations about the problem and the amount of individuals.

Other algorithms are being implemented...

This codes are being used by myself in the Laboratorio de Algoritmos
Experimentais (LAE) at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte - Natal - Brazil.
